The aim of this project is to replicate the experimental set-up created in [Shams et al. (2000)](https://www.nature.com/articles/35048669) "What you see is what you hear", investigating an audiovisual illusion. 

The experiment consists of a group of trials in which a combination of audio and visual stimuli are presented to the participant either once or twice in quick succession. The participant must then indicate if the visual stimulus appeared once or twice. However, the audio and visual stimuli do not match each time. Most importantly, there are times when the audio plays twice while the visual stimulus shows up once. These trials are the ones where the participants experience the illusion that the visual stimulus also appeared twice. 

In the experiment, the visual stimulus is a flashing white disk while tha audio stimulus is a simple beep.
